## Helpful HTML commands
`HTML` is very similar to `markdown` and `Rmarkdown`. `HTML` is written using tags. These follow the premise of an open and a close. You open the tag, for example to make words strong you use the tag `<strong>`. You would open the command with `<strong>` and then you would close the tag using a `/` - `</strong>`. You can see this in action `<strong>`<strong>here</strong>`</strong>`. `<strong>`<strong>If you forget to close the tag everything after the open tag will have the tag applied</strong>. The following are some useful tags and example uses.

* strong = `<strong>`my words`</strong>`
* italic = `<i>`<i>my words</i>`</i>`
* bold = `<b>`<b>my words</b>`</b>`

You can combine tags as well - `<b><i>`<b><i>my words</i></b>`</i></b>`

* link = `<a href="www.google.co.uk">`<a href="www.google.co.uk">google</a>`</a>`
* new line = `<br>`




* heading 1 = `<h1>`<h1>my words</h1>`</h1>`
* you can have lots of subheadings e.g. heading 5 `<h5>`<h5>my words</h5>`</h5>`
